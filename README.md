learnt from the official website

this is a 3D project including multiple interactions between the player and the system. it is about escaping a haunted house.
unfortuantely the project itself is way to big to be posted on git public repository, so i am only going to post the script part of the project and keep the full project on my own personal laptop. all of the scripts are c# scripts.

there is only one error that i can't find a way to fix(not the script part, somewhere in the game pannel about animator not attach to the game object, despite the error, the game object is able to move).

please note this project is not for profit-making. it is only for personal learnning purpose.
